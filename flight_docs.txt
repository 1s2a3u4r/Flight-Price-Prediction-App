## Flight Price Prediction Project

This project predicts flight ticket prices based on journey details, airline, source, destination, and stops.  
It uses a RandomForestRegressor trained on historical flight data.

We use Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

The user interface is built with Streamlit. Users can select departure date, arrival time, source, destination, and airline.

The model predicts the price in Indian rupees.

Future work includes adding LLM and RAG to answer questions, and using deep learning models.

Dataset had around 10,600 rows in training and 2,600 in testing.
Features include: Total_Stops, Journey_day, Journey_month, Dep_hour, Dep_min, Arrival_hour, Arrival_min, Duration_hours, Duration_mins, Airline, Source, Destination.

Common questions:
- How is the price predicted?
- Which algorithm is used?
- What data was used to train?
- How can the model be improved?
